Blockchain technology in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) offers potential solutions to security challenges. However, the significant redundancy in blockchain storage makes its implementation in IoV environments difficult. While numerous studies have addressed blockchain storage scalability, none of these solutions are directly applicable to the IoV. To tackle this issue, the present paper proposes a transaction pruning mechanism based on the directed acyclic graph lattice structure within the IoV. This mechanism takes into account the impact of transaction pruning on system security, transaction timeliness, and network resource usage. Given the highly dynamic nature of IoV, the paper employs a random selection-based hyper-heuristic algorithm to optimize the transaction pruning strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms other optimization methods in terms of average target deviation, target variance, and success rate.
