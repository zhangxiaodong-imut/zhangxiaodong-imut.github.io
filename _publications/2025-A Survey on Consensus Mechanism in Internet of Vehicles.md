Blockchain is a distributed technology that offers a feasible solution for enhancing trust, security, transparency, and immutability in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Consensus algorithm plays a key role in ensuring the security of blockchain, which can ensure the consistency and correctness of block data maintained by each blockchain node. However, the highly dynamic characteristics of IoV environments affects the stability and security of the blockchain consensus mechanism. Therefore, to enable broader application of blockchain in IoV scenarios, research on consensus mechanism is of great significance. This paper reviews relevant literature on consensus mechanism in IoV environments and classifies the studies based on their underlying working principles. Specifically, it analyzes the current state of research from two perspectives: proof-based consensus mechanism and voting-based consensus mechanism. Finally, the paper analyzes the challenges in this field and provides an outlook on future research trends. By presenting a systematic literature review, this paper aims to provide valuable insights and references for researchers in the field.
