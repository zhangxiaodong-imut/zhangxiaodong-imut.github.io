In recent years, Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) has developed significantly. Coordination between vehicles can enhance driving safety and improve traffic efficiency. Due to the high dynamic characteristic of VANET, security has become one of the challenging problems. Trust of the message is a key element of security in VANET. This paper proposes a Manhattan Distance Based Trust Management model (MDBTM) in VANET environment which solves the problem in existing trust management research that considers the distance between the sending vehicle and event location. In this model, the Manhattan distance and the number of building obstacles are calculated by considering the movement relationship between the sending vehicle and event location. The Dijkstra algorithm is used to predict the path with the maximum probability, when the vehicle is driving toward the event location. The message scores are then calculated based on the Manhattan distance and the number of building obstacles. Finally, the scores are fused to determine whether to trust the message. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance than similar methods in terms of correct decision probability under different proportions of malicious vehicles, different numbers of vehicles, and different reference ranges.
