Blockchain, a key technology in distributed ledger systems, is favored by both industry and academia for its decentralized, immutable, and tamper-proof characteristics, and is widely applied in fields such as cryptocurrency, the Internet of Things (IoT), and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, the issues of low throughput, high latency, and limited scalability have become major obstacles restricting the development of blockchain technology. Sharding, as one of the mainstream methods for blockchain scalability, can achieve high performance on-chain scaling without reducing the degree of decentralization. This paper classifies blockchain sharding technologies across multiple application scenarios and focuses on analyzing the research progress in three areas: cryptocurrency, IoT, and IoV. In the field of cryptocurrency, sharding technology is mainly used to improve throughput; in the IoT field, it addresses core issues such as scalability and security; in the IoV field, cross sharding technology promotes cross-domain communication and transaction processing in mobile scenarios. This paper summarizes relevant research achievements in recent years, points out current key issues such as equitable node distribution and security assurance, proposes related research directions, and provides suggestions for future research work.
